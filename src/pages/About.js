            <p> I’m a second year studying Cognitive Science & 
                Computer Science at UC Berkeley with a minor in English. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m really fascinated by computer science, and shamelessly 
                love the process of learning :) 
                I was recently at 
                <mark> <a href="https://www.minwo.co/"> MINWO </a> </mark>
                as a technical business operations intern, 
                and currently a software developer for
